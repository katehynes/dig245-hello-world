  <h1>Hello world!</h1>

  <h2>Answers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>My name is Kate Hynes, I'm a junior, and I'm a computer science major</li>
    <br>
    <li>I'm interested in web design; it seems like a creative application of computer science</li>
    <br>
    <li>I participated in a hackathon through CCAD and worked on front end development,
      but I didn't really know what I was doing. I have a fair amount of programming experience
      from the CS classes I've taken</li>
    <br>
    <li>My goal in this course is to get more familiar with web design. I'll probably do another
      Hackathon at some point, and I'd like to go into it more prepared and with a better idea of
      what kind of projects I can make. Also, this might be something I want to pursue as a job?</li>
    <br>
    <li>I did the command line, files and naming conventions, and web development environment activities.
      The command line activity covered basic commands to create files and folders and navigate through different
      file paths on the computer. The files and naming conventions activity described the best practices for
      naming files and folders to help with organization and to ensure that files would be able to convert between
      different formats. I did not realize that it's usually not a good idea to include whitespace characters
      in names because they might not translate into different file formats. Instead we should use dashes
      or underscores. The web development environment activity indicated different packages and shortcuts
      to assist with web design. I found the browser comparison charts interesting â€“ I expected Google to have a
      large portion, but I was a little surprised that Safari's user distribution dipped since 2019, considering
      Safari is the default browser for iOS/mobile products.</li>

    <li>Web-based projects:
      <ul>
        <li>Project 1</li> <!--use blockquote here instead, to seperate the links maybe?-->
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
