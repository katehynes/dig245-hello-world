      <li>My name is Kate Hynes, I'm a junior, and I'm a computer science major</li>
      <br>
      <li>I'm interested in web design; it seems like a creative application of computer science</li>
      <br>
      <li>I participated in a hackathon through CCAD and worked on front end development,
        but I didn't really know what I was doing. I have a fair amount of programming experience
        from the CS classes I've taken</li>
      <br>
      <li>My goal in this course is to get more familiar with web design. I'll probably do another
        Hackathon at some point, and I'd like to go into it more prepared and with a better idea of
        what kind of projects I can make. Also, this might be something I want to pursue as a job?</li>
      <br>
      <li>I did the <strong>command line, files and naming conventions,</strong> and
        <strong>web development environment</strong> activities. The <strong>command line</strong> activity covered basic commands
        to create files and folders and navigate through different file paths on the computer. The <strong>files and naming
          conventions</strong> activity described the best practices for naming files and folders to help with organization and to
        ensure that files would be able to convert between different formats. I did not realize that it's usually not
        a good idea to include whitespace characters in names because they might not translate into different file formats.
        Instead we should use dashes or underscores. The <strong>web development environment</strong> activity indicated different
        packages and shortcuts to assist with web design. I found the browser comparison charts interesting – I expected Google to
        have a large portion, but I was a little surprised that Safari's user distribution dipped since 2019, considering
        Safari is the default browser for iOS/mobile products.

            <li>"The Wiki Game," <a href="https://www.thewikigame.com/"> The Wiki Game </a> </li>
            <blockquote>This title caught my attention because I am interested in game development. I've heard of the wikipedia "game" before –
              seeing how to get to one topic on a wiki page from one completely unrelated – but I really liked that this project formalized the concept.
              The game has entertainment value, but it also illustrates the sheer amount of information available online.
